# Scheduler Application
This is a simple calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am-5pm). The application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. It utilizes the Day.js library to work with date and time.

## Functionality

The calendar application provides the following functionality:



The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.

Timeblocks are displayed for each hour of the standard business hours (9am-5pm).

Each timeblock is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.

Users can click on a timeblock to enter an event or task for that hour.

Users can save the entered event by clicking the save button for the corresponding timeblock.

The saved events are stored in the local storage of the browser.

When the page is refreshed, the saved events persist and are displayed in the respective timeblocks.
